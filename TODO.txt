TODO:

x Write a way to specify on the command line which TCP flags to set.
x Write a module to treat command-line arguments as key-value pairs
* Build injector/reacter which fires off forged packets created by the crafter as a reaction to network activity
(NOTE: Session Hijacking is nearly impossible without be able to sniff the LAN. In terms of module design the
 packet crafter should sit above (or be called by the injector) passing the injector all necessary information
sniffed numbers (seq, ack, len) and argument values)
* Build underlying IP/TCP packet crafter (needs to account for the command-line args!)
* Write a suite of tools that parses and writes HTTP commands at the packet level

Questions:

Will I have to do my own fragmentation if a packet exceeds the MTU of the network? Or will libnet handle 
this aspect of packet injection? Am I creating a packet or a datagram?

## WRATH
#### <i> What? Really? Another TCP Hijacker? </i>

<code> wrath [options] [operation] [filter] </code>

This project hopes to teach the programmer more about both network
programming and common LAN-based man-in-the-middle attacks. 

_Dependencies_: libnet, pcap

_Disclaimer_:
This project was heavily influenced by Jon Erickson's book, "Hacking:
The Art of Exploitation". Many of the practices and techniques used in
this codebase I learned from that book.
